= What is Search4JModel =

*Search4JModel* is used to advise *Search4J* on the details of how the search should be executed.

1. Create a new model object using the constructor:

<code language="java">
public Search4JModel(String query, boolean matchWholeWordOnly, boolean caseSensitive, boolean regularExpression)</code>

If the *regularExpression* argument is _true_, then the library will ignore *matchWholeWordOnly* and *caseSensitive* fields. 

2. Set the *text* property that will be used to match the *query*:

<code language="java">
model.setText("Text I want to search in");</code>

Please note, that *Search4JModel* is an immutable object where only the *text* property can be changed. 

The creation of a new *Search4JModel* object is relatively expensive (as the regular expression/match whole word pattern fields are pre-compiled at the construction time). 

So, if you are doing thousands of searches, re-use the same model if possible. However, if the design of your application doesn't allow it, please measure the performance before making any radical changes.

To make a copy of an existing *Search4JModel* object, please use its *clone* method.
